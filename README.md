# surf-gui
a gui version of surf using rofi + a sh script
# the purpose of surf-gui
the purpose of this is for me, because i don't understand the terminal like an expert would. 
and for maybe other folks like me who don't like typing too many lines of code there.
# how to set up surf-gui
1. install surf first(obviously, credits to the owner)
   pacman = sudo pacman -S yay; yay -S surf
   apt = sudo apt install surf
   for other pkg managers, i don't know because i never used void, gentoo or alpine linux, etc as my daily drivers.
2. run .sh script
   download the .sh script provided
   chmod the script using "chmod +x surf-gui.sh"
   now finally,
   "./surf-gui.sh"
